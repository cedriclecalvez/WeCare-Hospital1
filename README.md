**Express :** a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile applications

<!-- **TypeScript :** an open-source language which builds on JavaScript, one of the world’s most used tools, by adding static type definitions -->

<!-- **Mongoose :** Mongoose is a Node. js based Object Data Modeling (ODM) library for MongoDB. -->

<!-- **MongoDB :** MongoDB is an open-source document-oriented database. It is used to store a larger amount of data and also allows you to work with that data. MongoDB is not based on the table-like relational database structure but provides an altogether different mechanism for storage and retrieval of data, that’s why known as NoSQL database. Here, the term ‘NoSQL’ means ‘non-relational’. The format of storage is called BSON ( similar to JSON format). -->
